# Sign-up Form

## Description
This project implements a Sign-up form.  The content of the form was inspired by the series *The Boys*. In this form, the user is invited to
the premiere of the movie, "*Dawn of The Seven*".  To win a chance at being invited, the user must sign-up.

This was done as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) **Intermediate HTML and CSS Course**.  Despite this project being part of the [Intermediate HTML and CSS Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/intermediate-html-and-css), I managed to validate the form via Exception Handling.
